## About

This Visualizer offers an interactive environment to experiment with and compare classical CPU scheduling algorithms:

- **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**
- **Shortest Job First (SJF)**
- **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)**
- **Round Robin (RR)**
- **Priority Scheduling**

Each algorithm reveals its scheduling timeline and performance metrics such as average turnaround time, waiting time, and response time, making it an educational tool for students and professionals alike.

## Features

- **Algorithm Selection**: Choose and switch between multiple scheduling strategies.
- **Dynamic Simulation**: Visualizes process execution and CPU assignment over time.
- **Detailed Metrics**: Calculates and presents performance comparisons across algorithms.
- **User Interface**: Created with Python (likely `tkinter`—adjust if it's via another GUI or web platform).
- **Easy Input**: Define processes with their arrival time, burst time, and priority.
